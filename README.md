# Mathmania
Hello there! For academic purposes I have created a math website for children in grades 1-3 to practice their mental math skills such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division. There is a review page that allows for students to review concepts studied in class and essentially grow into independent learners.
Lastly to keep the students motivated to keep practing I have also created a memory card game that will allow students to have a break when they have reached sufficient
progress in their learning. In order for anyone to have acccess to the review and practice materials they need to have an account.
