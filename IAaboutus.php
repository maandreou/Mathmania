        <p> Mathmania is a website designed to give young students an opportunity to practice their mental math skills
            through fun and easy to follow exercises. We want to help young students feel encouraged and motivated to
            practice their mental math skills by offering them a range of resources that cover essential skills, however
            in order to give our little mathmaniacs the practice required, we have designed exercises that reflect a
            difficulty level we find appropriate for each grade level. In our practice page you can find first grade addition
            and subtraction exercises with numbers between 1-20, second grade addition, subtraction exercises with numbers
            between 1-50, and third grade addition, subtraction, multiplication and division exercises with numbers between
            1-100. We hope you will enjoy using our website and improve your mental math in the topics you need to!</p>
